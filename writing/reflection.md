Please answer the following questions after you have completed the programming lab. Write your answers in complete sentences and provide thoughtful responses.

## Comprehension Questions

1. What is the purpose of breaking a program into functions? How did this help you in completing the lab?

Your Response: Functions allow for the code to be easily be organized and if there were a problem than you'd be able to diagnose the location of the problem easily.

2. Describe how you validated user input in your version of the Rock, Paper, Scissors game. Why is input validation important?

Your Response: Input validation is important because it allows for your code to run smoothly, not allowing an input that will mess up your code.

3. How did you use comments and docstrings in your code? Give an example of a helpful comment or docstring you wrote.

Your Response: I used comments to explain the purpose of the code i write, in my main function i have a comment that tells me when i call the randomized function that it randomized.

4. Explain how the computer's move is generated in your program. What Python features did you use to accomplish this?

Your Response: the computer randomly generates a value for rock, paper, or scissors, and then it puts it up against the users input.

5. What was the most challenging part of refactoring the spaghetti code into a more structured program? How did you overcome this challenge?

Your Response: I didnt really come over a challenging part.

## Ethical Reflection Questions

1. Why is it important to write code that is easy for others to read and maintain? How does this relate to your responsibilities as a programmer?

Your Response: Its important because if you ever have to have someone review your code, or your working in a group, the code needs to be easy to understand and read.

2. Consider the use of open source code (like the spaghetti code provided). What are some ethical considerations when using, modifying, or sharing code written by others?

Your Response: possibly being transparent with when you use outside code and giving reference.
